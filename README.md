# 30 Minute Film Festival


Kallos is a website that was made to showcase the different styles accross the University with an assigned newsletter sign-up by request.

<h1> Process: </h1>
The process that took place to create this website started by making the film festival in class, and after that came the point at which we had to design the wireframe for it. At last, the most challenging part came in which the website coding took place to create the final product. 

<h1> The Wireframe </h1>
The wireframe was nothing but a simple idea of what was meant to be the final product. The wireframe was a simple outline of the first page due to knowing that the final product would not look that similar to it. There was no need to go into details due to always knowing that complications would arise regarding the coding part of the project.

<h1> The difficulties </h1>
The difficulties came rushing once the coding part started, from errors to missing dashes, you name it, and the code had it. The most difficult part was the background of the pages, then came the email newsletter form, and at last, the creation of an Instagram page; for some reason, the Instagram page kept getting banned, and so the result was to link the Instagram page section with the official NYU account. Yet the difficulties continued when trying to upload it all onto GitHub; for some reason, the page would not want to get published.
